# Data Engineering on Campaign Contributions

This is a short read me for clarifying the code written for the [donation analytic challenge](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/donation-analytics).

## Summary of the task:

The data engineer is asked to provide insights for cash-strapped political candidates.
We would like to explore the repeat donors (donors who have donated in previous records). We want to see how loyal are the repeat donors to each candidate (recepient) .
We define a **reception** as donation to a particular recepient in a particular year and a particular area (zip code).
We need to calculate for each reception the following: the number of donation receivied, the total amount of donations received, and the percentile given as an output.

## Data

The data can be found [here](https://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/metadata/DataDictionaryContributionsbyIndividuals.shtml).
